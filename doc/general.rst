General information
===================

This BSP consists of several software components:

* U-Boot (based on v2015.10)
* Linux kernel (based on v4.2.5)
* Root filesystem (based on Debian Jessie 8.2)

These components are tied together to build a single image file, which can be
flashed to the internal eMMC or on SD card.
