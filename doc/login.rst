To get shell access to the Duckbill, you can connect to the device via network
using SSH protocol, or locally by using the Debug UART. Please note, that the
Debug UART has 3.3 V level, so do not connect it directly to your PCs serial
port. We recommend to use an USB to UART TTL level adapter; there are plenty
products available.

At both methods, a login prompt is presented. Default credentials are:

* username *root*
* password *root*
