Summary
=======

This directory contains the NXP/Freescale manufacturing tool (mfgtool2) which
can be used to flash the STIB generated image into the eMMC of an I2SE product.

For this, force the I2SE product into bootloader mode. Please see individual
product documentation on how to achieve this. Then open MfgTool2 to start the
flash process.

Both Linux and Windows versions of MfgTool2 are distributed under BSD 3-clause
license, the Windows version also includes a file containing The Code Project
Open License (CPOL) 1.02.

I2SE distributes the binaries for customer convenience, but did not modify the
standard/original distribution. The source code for MfgTool2 can be found online
in a GitHub repository at: https://github.com/codeauroraforum/mfgtools
